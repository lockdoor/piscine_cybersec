This project is learning path of Piscine Cyber Security of 42Bangkok.

Project learn about malware like ransomeware I use python with library cryptography to complete the project

The malware is encrypt file with AES(Fernet) algorithm then encrypt key of AES with RSA

The program set target file to encrypt in Dir /home/[user]/infection and key for decrypt store in /home/[user]/pri.pem


## RUN PROGRAM
options:

  - -h [show this help message and exit]
  - -r [Key to decrypt]
  - -s [Encrypt or Decrypt with silent mode]
  - -v [show program's version number and exit]
